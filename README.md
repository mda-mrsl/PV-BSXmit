# PV-BSXmit: Bloch-Siegert Transmit Gain Calibration

# What is this repository for?
This repository contains the methods to peform transmit gain calibration on the Bruker (Paravision) platform. Specifically, this method can be used for fast and automated TG calibration for 13C and HP 129Xe MRI on a preclinical 7T scanner.

*This method has only been tested using the CentOS 5.11 operating system and Parvision V6.0.1 (PV6.0.1)*.

# How do I get set up?
* *bsSinglePulse_6.0.1.PvUserSrcMethod* is the name of the Bloch-Siegert transmit gain source method file. Copy *bsSinglePulse_6.0.1.PvUserSrcMethod* to **/opt/PV6.0.1/share** and import (**File->Import->Source Method**) the method file to **${PVHOME}/prog/curdir/${USER}/ParaVision/methods** using PV6.0.1.
* A MATLAB (The Mathworks) analysis script can be implemented as a standalone executable function that can be called automatically following data acquisition. The *BlochSiegert_TGCalibration* folder contains: *TransmitGain_BlochSiegert.m* and *readBrukerHeader.m*, *recoBrukerKSpace.m*, *readBrukerFid.m*, *rfCalBruker.m*, and *ifftdim.m*. *TransmitGain_BlochSiegert.m* is the main analysis script, with the others being necessary supporting scripts. Compile the files using the package app tool in MATLAB (2013a) and copy the compiled executable file to **${PVHOME}/prog/curdir/${USER}/ParaVision/macros**.
* *FERMI_Bloch Siegert.exc* contains an optimized Fermi shaped RF pulse that can be used for off-resonant Bloch-Siegert pulse generation. Copy *FERMI_Bloch Siegert.exc* to **${PVHOME}/prog/curdir/${USER}/ParaVision/exp/lists/wave**.
